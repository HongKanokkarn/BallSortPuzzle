# Ball Sort Puzzle
###### We have 16 balls. Each ball is labeled by either A, B, C, or D. We also have 6 stacks. 
###### Each stack can contain 4 balls. The 16 balls are randomly placed in 4 stacks.  Two stacks are left empty.
###### The goal of this puzzle is to sort the balls by label, so that 4 non-empty stacks contain 4 balls of the same label. There are two restrictions:
###### 1. Only the top ball of each stack can be moved, and
###### 2. A ball can only be placed on top of another ball of the same label or in an empty stack.
